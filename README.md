# workenv
My Working Environment

This project standardizes the various configuration files and setup I prefer to use in Linux.

Running setup.sh will configure a few things:
 * .profile
 * .bashrc
 * .inputrc
 * Vim
   * .vimrc
   * Vim Plugins
 * GNU Screen

## .profile
This file is used when a session is started for a login shell.  My preferred .profile does a few things:
 * Source .bashrc if present
 * Add a few directories to the path if present

## .bashrc

## .inputrc

## Vim
